# Eskwegifts
This was my group's final output and presentation for Data Analytics Bootcamp with Eskwelabs

More about Eskwegifts: 
EskweGifts is an e-commerce start-up that sells multiple SKUs via its online platform. What sets the company apart from its other counterparts is the high-customizability of its products; each SKU can be tailor-made for consumer use. The company launched in 2022, but management has noticed that their bottomline margins are decreasing YoY.

My team was hired to provide insights on the following:
1. Why the decrease is happening 
2. How to monitor and improve company processes

Note: We were tasked to specifically focus on the commercial aspect (Seasonality and Trends, Shipping structure, and Margin Optimization)
